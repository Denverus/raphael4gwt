a vector drawing application for the web based on raphaeljs. 

this project started as a final app that try to be the prove of concept of two other
GWT libraries of mine, raphael4gwt and gwteditors. A vector editor is a very good 
test for proving a vector drawing framework as raphael4gwt. gwteditors
will help in the task of fast raphael shape properties GUI edition.  
And of course, java is an exceptionally good language for 
implementing a complex visual editor. 

This is a GWT application and it depends on my two other projects 
raphael4gwt and gwteditors

this editor will use the raphael4gwt API directly for referencing shapes. 
The user  will be really doing raphael API visually.
